def get_grade_history_for_course(course_id: int) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Fetch the full grade change history for a specific course.

    This function queries the Canvas API to retrieve all recorded grade change 
    events in a course's gradebook. Each event contains information such as 
    who changed a grade, which student's grade was affected, what the old 
    and new grades were, and when the change occurred.

    Args:
        course_id (int): The Canvas course ID to retrieve grade history from.

    Returns:
        List[Dict[str, Any]]: A list of dictionaries, each representing a 
        grade change event. Fields in each event may include:
            - 'user_id': ID of the student whose grade was changed
            - 'grader_id': ID of the person who changed the grade
            - 'assignment_id': ID of the assignment whose grade changed
            - 'grade_before' / 'grade_after': Old and new grades
            - 'graded_at': Timestamp of when the grade change occurred
            - Other metadata related to the grade change

    Raises:
        Exception: If the API request fails (non-200 status code).

    Note:
        - This will only return grade changes that are *recorded* by Canvas.
        - If no grades were changed, the returned list will be empty.

    """
    Retrieve the current grades for all active students in a specific course.

    This function queries the Canvas API to get a list of all active student enrollments 
    in a course, along with each student's current grade and score. 
    It organizes the returned data into a clean, structured format, including 
    the student's name, user ID, and grade details.

    Args:
        course_id (int): The Canvas course ID from which to fetch student grades.

    Returns:
        List[Dict[str, Any]]: A list of dictionaries, one per student, each containing:

                - 'current_score': The student's current percentage score (e.g., 88.5)

    Raises:
        Exception: If the API request fails (non-200 status code).

    Note:
        - Only active enrollments (not dropped or inactive students) are included.
